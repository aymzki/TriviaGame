# TriviaGame

A trivia game using jQuery timer that tests the user's knowledge on bread. 


## How It Works

* In this quiz there are 10 questions total. 
* You will have 20 seconds to answer each question. There will be a countdown at the top of each question.
* If you click the right answer button, the screen will say "Success!" then move on to the next question after 3 seconds.
* If you click the wrong answer button, the screen will say "Wrong Answer!" and give you the actual answer. The screen will move on to the next question after 5 seconds.
* If you do not click on any answer button, the screen will say "Time's Up!" and move on to the next question after 5 seconds. 
* After the final question, the page will show a tally of how many you got right, how many you got wrong, and how many questions were unanswered.
* There will be a restart button to click to start the game again without refreshing the page.
